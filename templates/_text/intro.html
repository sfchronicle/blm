<p>Seven and a half years after Oscar Grant was shot in the back by a BART police officer on an Oakland train platform, videos of officers killing black men — most recently Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota — have become their own grim genre, at once impossible to watch but critical to see.</p>

<p>Shown repeatedly on television and spread on social media, the videos have sparked mass protests and calls for police reform. But for African Americans, watching the footage and following the cases feels inescapably personal, touching nearly every aspect of their lives.</p>

<p>The Chronicle reached out to a number of African American people in the Bay Area — among them a comedian, a college student, a rapper, a doctor, a historian, a police officer and the mother of Oscar Grant. They all spoke about how they view the recent killings and how they’ve responded to them. They also recounted some of their own interactions with officers.</p>

<p>As people around the country debate police tactics and policy, black people say they are also thinking about their safety and their place in society. They worry about the next time they interact with police, and about difficult conversations they need to have with their children.</p>
